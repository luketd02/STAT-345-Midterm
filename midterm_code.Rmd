Four Point Arc Proposal
```{r}
# Calculate distance from basket (0,0) and success rate
bucks_shots_2010_2019_2 <- bucks_shots_2010_2019 %>%
  mutate(distance = sqrt(locationX^2 + locationY^2) / 10)  # Convert to feet

# Bin distances and compute success rate
distance_summary <- bucks_shots_2010_2019_2 %>%
  mutate(distance_bin = floor(distance / 2) * 2) %>%  # 2-ft bins
  group_by(distance_bin) %>%
  summarise(shots = n(), made = sum(isShotMade), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(fg_pct = made / shots)

# Expected value for 3-point vs. hypothetical 4-point
distance_summary <- distance_summary %>%
  mutate(ev_3pt = fg_pct * 3, ev_4pt = fg_pct * 4)

# Decision: Propose 4-point arc at 28 ft
# Reasoning: There is about a 3.5% drop off in shooting percentage from 26 to 28 feet as well as a considerable drop off in the number of shots taken between these ranges. A 4-point arc at this spot will increase the risk/reward effect on the game, and it will also increase in fan excitement for watching deeper shots.
#Consequence: This deeper 4-point arc will result in a greater number of shots being taken from this distance from the basket, especially teams in desperate need of points. Due to the increased difficulty of shots taken at this range, players who previously shot many 3-pointers will begin shooting from the 4-point arc more and will likely suffer decreases to their overall shooting percentages.
